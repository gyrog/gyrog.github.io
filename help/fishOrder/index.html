<h2 class="awverh"><a href="index.html">fishOrder</a> - Overview</h2>
<div class="awverd"> <br />
Version: 1.4.8<br />
<br /></div>

<p>"fishOrder" is a program for producing a document using the <a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/">Revised Common Lectionary</a> and related data.<br />
(Revised Common Lectionary copyright (c) 1992 Consultation on Common Texts admin. Augsburg Fortress. Reproduced by permission.)</p>
<p>It's based on the idea that in any regular 'Order of Service', 'Pew Sheet', etc..., there are three types of information:<br />
Permanent information that hardly ever changes;<br />
Information that changes every week, but is predictable;<br />
Information that changes every week but is not predictable.</p>
<p>"fishOrder" provides for permanent information with a small number of templates.<br />
Most of "fishOrder" is about storing and managing predictable information, as fields that are merged with a template to produce a document.<br />
When the base document is generated, it is opened in an editor, where you can add the unpredictable information.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html">fishOrder</a> - Features</h2>
<p>Templates can be edited and/or created to suit local requirements.<br /> 
Templates and documents are '.rtf' files, small and very portable.<br />
Automatic three year calendar that is generated the first time you run "fishOrder". Automatically updated the first time you run "fishOrder" in a new year.<br />
When run, automatically shows the current information for next Sunday.<br />
Alternates can be viewd and selected.<br />
Hymns can be chosen from defined collections so their title is included in the document.<br />
Hymn collections can be either hymn books or folders containing lists of titles, e.g. a folder of slides.<br />
Any file/document on the computer used as a resource for this occasion can be associated with this Lectionary day.<br />
All alternate choices, hymn and document associations are stored and shown the next time this Lectionary day occurs.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html">fishOrder</a> - Program interface</h2>
<p>Screens in "fishOrder" show the current information in the body of the screen on the left.<br />
On the right, is a column of buttons that provide facilities to manipulate the information on the left.<br />
These buttons are ordered so that the ones towards the top are usually used before the ones towards the bottom.</p>
<p>Screens in "fishOrder" automatically adjust their size to fit the information they contain.<br />
The main screen does not do this, however it's size can be adjusted by dragging it's edges.<br />
Changing the size of the main screen is permanent, (until it is dragged to a different size).</p>
