<h2 class="awverh"><a href="index.html">fishTop</a> - Overview</h2>
<div class="awverd"> <br />
Version: 3.1.3<br />
<br /></div>

<h4 class="awbot">Description</h4>
<p class="awin1 awtop">"fishTop" provides a simple interface for running many other programs as required.<br />
Usually these will be differrent programs for different media.<br />
So, it can run "PowerPoint" to display ".pps" files. And other programs for other file types.<br />
Each one activated by a single click.</p>

<p class="awin1">Note: fishTop does not copy any media files. It references them, in place.</p>

<h4 class="awbot">Using fishTop</h4>
<ul class="awtop">
  <li><strong>Playing/projecting one of a pre-defined list of media files during a service.</strong><br />
    This is the easiest.<br />
    Using the Main screen, click on the button showing the name of the file, and it happens.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setting-up the pre-defined list of media files.</strong><br />
    This is only a little more difficult.<br />
    Using the <a href="select.html">Select screen</a>, navigate to the folder(s) containing the required media files and select them.<br />
    Then arrange the list of files into the order that is required when the list is shown as buttons on the Main screen.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setting-up fishTop to be able to process the required media types.</strong><br />
    This is the most difficult step, but it usually only needs to be done once for each media type.<br />
    There are 2 ways of doing this:<br />
    <ol>
		<li>Using the <a href="options.html">Options screen</a>, define an "Executable for Extension" command to be used for media files with a specified extension.<br />
		This is fishTop's first preference, and the recommended method.<br />
		</li>
		<li>Configure the application as the default application for the media type.<br />
		fishTop uses this method if no command has been defined for the file's extension.<br /> 
		</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>First time configuration.</strong><br />
    Configure "Primary path" in the <a href="options.html">Options screen</a>. This defines the folder that contains collections of media files.<br />
    A more detailed explanation of the "Primary path" option can be found on the <a href="options.html">Options screen</a> help page.<br />
    To navigate to the <a href="options.html">Options screen</a> on Windows, right-click on the main screen, then click on the "Options" button.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Media applications.</strong><br />
    For any media file, fishTop needs an application capable of playing/projecting the file, to be installed and suitably configured.<br />
    To project slides, PowerPoint might be installed and configured to display slide shows on the projector monitor.<br />
    To project video files, Zoom player might be installed and configured to play in full screen, without any splash screen, on the projector moniotor, and then close itself.<br />
    <br />
    On Windows, support for ".pps" and ".ppsx" files is configured by default.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="index.html">fishTop</a> - Main screen</h2>

<h4 class="awbot">Body of screen</h4>

<p class="awin1 awtop">This contains a list of items that can be displayed or played. Each item is a button that can be clicked to activate the item.<br />
If there are more than 12 items, the list will scroll to access the other items.<br />
If an item begins with "[M]", it refers to Multiple files, clicking this item will activate the other referenced file(s) as well as the one displayed. Useful for projecting the words of a hymn, and playing a music file for the hymn, at the same time.</p>

<h4 class="awbot">Right click</h4>

<p class="awin1 awtop">To keep this production interface simple, the <a href="select.html">setup/configuration screens</a> are hidden, but activated with a right-click of the mouse.</p>
