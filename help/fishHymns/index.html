<p>"fishHymns" is a program for generating a midi file for a whole hymn (or song).</p>

<p>It uses a collection of tunes which are stored as a midi file for a single verse, and a list of meters it implements.<br />
It uses the meter of the hymn to find a suitable tune, then based on the number of verses it writes a single midi file conatining a suitable number of copies of the tune verse.</p>

<p>Hint: Before any hymn midis can be generated, there needs to be some tunes in the tune collection.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html">fishHymns</a> - Features</h2>

<p>The tempo and midi instrument for the output file can be specified.<br />
A short pause, (of a quarter note duration), can optionally be inserted between each verse.<br />
Facilities to maintain the tune collection are included.</p>

<p>Screens in "fishHymns" show the current information in the body of the screen on the left.<br />
On the right, is a column of buttons that provide facilities to manipulate the information on the left.<br />
These buttons are ordered so that the ones towards the top are usually used before the ones towards the bottom.</p>

<p>Screens in "fishHymns" automatically adjust their size to fit the information they contain.<br />
The main screen does not do this, however it's size can be adjusted by dragging it's edges.<br />
