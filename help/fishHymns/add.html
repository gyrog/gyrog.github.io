Version: 1.1.1<br />
<br /></div>

<p>There is no single "Add" screen.</p>

<p>The process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Establish a name for the new midi file.</li>
  <li>If possible, get "Meter" and "Verses" from stored hymn books.</li>
  <li>Open the "<a href="edit.html">Edit</a>" dialog, defaulting to found information, if any.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="awbot">Simple case</h4>
<p class="awin1 awtop">The "<a href="options.html">Use collections</a>" option has not been set.</p>
<p class="awin1">A simple dialog opens in which the name of the new midi file is entered.<br />
If this name contains a reference to a stored hymn book, e.g. "(AHB 123)", then data will be retrieved from the stored hymn book.<br />
An "<a href="edit.html">Edit</a>" dialog will be opened. It will show "Meter" and "Verses" values if they could be retrieved, else it will be empty.<br />
On sucessfull completion of the dialog, the new midi file is generated.</p>

<h4 class="awbot">Hymn Book case</h4>
<p class="awin1 awtop">The "<a href="options.html">Use collections</a>" option has been set.<br />
And the collection name matches a stored hymn book. e.g "AHB", (The Australian Hymn Book).</p>
<p class="awin1">A standard file selection dialog opens, listing all the hymns in the hymn book.<br />
Selecting one of these, sets the name of the new midi file to be the same as the list entry, minus the extension.<br />
An "<a href="edit.html">Edit</a>" dialog will be opened with the "Meter" and "Verses" values set to those in the stored hymn book.<br />
On sucessfull completion of the dialog, the new midi file is generated.</p>

<h4 class="awbot">Other collections case</h4>
<p class="awin1 awtop">The "<a href="options.html">Use collections</a>" option has been set.<br />
And a corresponding collection exists for the selected midi folder.</p>
<p class="awin1">A standard file selection dialog opens, allowing the selection of a folder represeting a corresponding collection.<br />
Selecting one of these files, sets the name of the new midi file to be the same as the list entry, minus the extension.<br />
If this name contains a reference to a stored hymn book, e.g. "(AHB 123)", then data will be retrieved from the stored hymn book.<br />
An "<a href="edit.html">Edit</a>" dialog will be opened. It will show "Meter" and "Verses" values if they could be retrieved, else it will be empty.<br />
On sucessfull completion of the dialog, the new midi file is generated.</p>
