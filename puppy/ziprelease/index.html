<h1>ZIP-RELEASE</h1>

<h2>Axioms</h2>

<p>Uefi booting does not need or use an 'mbr',<br />
just an appropriately populated '/EFI/' directory in the root of a 'fat32' partition.</p>

<p>All OS's can extract the contents of a '.zip' archive.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project demonstrates that Puppy Linux does not need to be released as a '.iso' file, there are aternatives.</p>

<p>Each archive contains a copy of a Puppy Linux frugal install, suitable for use on a usb stick.<br />
This includes Grub2 configured to boot the included Puppy Linux.<p>

<p>The advantage of using a '.zip' archhive is that there is no need to install any 3rd-party software to start using Puppy Linux.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Start with an empty usb stick.<br />
Download one of the '.zip' files and extract it's contents onto the usb stick.<br />
On Windows you can right-click on the '.zip' file, and select "Extract All...".</p>

<p>If using Windows to do this, it's probably a good idea to execute the '\win-util\Turn_Off_Fast_Startup.bat' file that is on the usb stick.</p>

<p>On some machines, that will be enough, uefi boot the usb stick.<br />
On others, you may need to define the fat32 partition as bootable;<br />
On Linux set the "boot" flag using "gparted";<br />
On Windows "Set partition active" in "Disk Management".</p>

<h2>.sfs files</h2>

<p>These are a more recent development.<br />
They have the same contents as a '.zip' file.</p>

<p>The advantage of a '.sfs' file is that it can be directly booted by Grub2, just like Grub2 can boot a '.iso' file.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of a '.sfs' file is the absence of support in native Windows for extracting it's contents.<br />
Although it can be extracted to a usb stick with a command like:<br />
"unsquashfs -f -d /mnt/sdc1 /path/to/the/Puppy_release.sfs"</p>

<p>The contents of a '.sfs' file can be listed with a command like:<br />
"unsquashfs -l /path/to/the/Puppy_release.sfs"</p>

<p>Note: Please do not confuse one of these '.sfs' files that contain a complete Puppy frugal install with a 'puppy_...sfs' file, which is one of the files inside it.</p>

<h2>Download files</h2>
