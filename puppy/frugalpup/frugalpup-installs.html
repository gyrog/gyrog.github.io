<h1>FrugalPup - Frugal installs</h1>

<p>Frugal installs are not "frugal" in capabilities, they are "frugal" in their disk usage.<br />
A frugal install is installed to a directory, not a partition. So a single partition can support many Puppy frugal installs.</p>

<p>A Puppy Linux release contains a 'vmlinuz', 'initrd.gz' and a small number of '.sfs' files.<br />
Each '.sfs' file is a compressed, read-only filesystem that can be mounted as a pseudo-partition.<br />
Together these few '.sfs' files contain the many files that are Puppy Linux.<br />
A frugal install accesses the contents of these '.sfs' files by mounting them, it does not extract their contents.<br />
So a typical Puppy frugal install directory will contain about 10 files.</p>

<p>The root filesystem of a Puppy frugal install is a stack, or union, of directories that appear to be merged, via an "aufs" pseudo-filesystem.<br />
The mount-point of each '.sfs' file is used as a read-only layer in this stack.</p>
